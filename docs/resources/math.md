# Mathematics books

## Books for Parents

### High school

I believe parents must have a good understanding of rigor in mathematics to help their kids in mid or high shool. This doesn't need to be taught, but having a good grasp will make sure you don't equate intuition with rigor.

I would highly recommend completing the following book. This is a beginner level mathematics book but without sacrificing rigor. This requires a lot of patience. Don't try to read this in a few days. You need to understand and remember almost everything you learn to continue understanding later topics without difficulties. You will need a pen and paper.

1. [Basic Mathematics - Serge Lang](https://www.amazon.com/Basic-Mathematics-Serge-Lang/dp/0387967877)

If you find the above book difficult, read one of the following.

2. [Algebra - Gelfand](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773) - A very simple introduction to algebra

3. [Algebra - David Morin Part 1 & 2](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Enthusiastic-Beginner-David-Morin-ebook/dp/B0DCKGGMHW)

You could read the following in parallel to `Serge Lang`'s book. These cover all topics from elementary school to high school. These aren't for kids and these aren't simpe books. These books are meant for teachers and includes decent amount of rigor.

4. [Various books by Hung-Hsi Wu](https://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/)


### Elementary school

It's difficult to suggest books for elementary school. Some of the following books might help you.

1. [Arithmetic - Paul Lockhart](https://www.amazon.com/Arithmetic-Paul-Lockhart/dp/067423751X) - This is a fun book, especially if you are intersted in numbers, their origin and history.

2. [Mathematics for Elementary Teachers with Activities](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Elementary-Teachers-Activities-5th/dp/0134392795) - This isn't a great book. But it will definitely give you some ideas or direction for this difficult job.


### Popular math books

Following "pop math" books are really good. Pick a few and read them. You won't need pen and paper. They will give you a good understanding and intuition needed for learning and teaching mathematics. Kids might be able to read these with some help from you.

1. [The Number Devil](https://www.amazon.com/Number-Devil-Mathematical-Adventure/dp/0805062998) - I consider this a must read. Kids should be able to read this with some help.

2. [Number Sense](https://www.amazon.com/Number-Sense-Creates-Mathematics-Revised/dp/0199753873) - This might not be useful, if you don't care about neuroscience or psychology.

3. [Joy of X](https://www.amazon.com/Joy-Guided-Tour-Math-Infinity/dp/0544105850) - Might be the most popular "pop math" book of all time.

4. [Alex's Adventures In Numberland](https://www.amazon.com/Alexs-Adventures-In-Numberland/dp/1526623994)


## Books for Kids

You should also encourage your kids to read books. I would recommend books by `Harold R. Jacobs` and `Robert G. Brown`.

You should place emphasis on completing books, either mathematics or otherwise. Boooks provide understanding and insights into the topic, not possible in today's CHATGPT/youtube/khan-academy world.
