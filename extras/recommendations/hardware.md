## Keyboards

### Split Keyboards

Generally split keyboards are preferrable for touch typists. Most split keyboards are ergonomic. Usually takes time to get used to.

1. [Glove 80](https://www.moergo.com/) - This is the best ergonomic split keyboard but only for touch typists. It will take a really long time to get used to.

2. [Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) - Very portable, less ergonomic, very popular.

3. [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) - Easy to get used to, currently the most poular.

4. [Dygma Defy](https://dygma.com/pages/defy) - A lot of moonlander users are switching to this.

If you want to spend least amount of time learning a new keyboard layout, or if you are not a touch typist, or want a cheaper alternative.

1. [Keychron Q11](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q11-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard) - If you end up not liking split keyboard, you could just use this as a normal keyboard too.

2. [RKS70](https://www.amazon.com/RK-ROYAL-KLUDGE-Bluetooth-Mechanical/dp/B0C88V7LQK) - Maybe the best budget split keyboard.

Keys are a personal preference, most popular are cherry mx blue, red, brown.

- Blue would be very loud and clicky.

- Red will be relatively more silent and is considered best for gamers and programmers. Red are also more closer to common membrane keyboards and some people hate this.

- Brown if you like a bit clicky compared to Red but almost as silent as red. This is the safest choice, if it's your first mechanical keyboard.

My personal preference is Cherry MX Red.

### Mouse

Mouse is always a personal choice, you might hate what's considered the best. Always try before buying.

1. [Logitech MX Master 3s](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Pale/dp/B09HMKFDXC) - If you like heave mouse. Not good for gamers. Otherwise this is the most popular mouse. I don't like this mouse much, a bit too heavy.

2. [Logitech G Pro X](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Superlight-Lightspeed-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09NBWL8J5) - Lightweight, Wireless, most popular for gamers. I love this mouse. Ambidextrous, really useful if you suspect your RSI is due to your mouse usage.

3. [Logitech G 305](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07CMS5Q6N) - Similar to Pro X, lot cheaper, but with AA battery. Not as lightweight. Ambidextrous.

4. [Logitech G203](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSYNC-Wired-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07YN82X3B) - Really cheap. But really good. I use it with all of my secondary setups.

5. [Logitech MX Vertical](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT) - If you suspect your RSI is due to your mouse usage. Currently, I don't use this.


### Laptop

1. [Asus Zenbook S14](https://www.asus.com/in/laptops/for-home/zenbook/asus-zenbook-s-14-ux5406/) - Lightweight, good performance, very good battery life.

2. [Asus Zephyrus G16](https://rog.asus.com/in/laptops/rog-zephyrus/rog-zephyrus-g16-2024-ga605/) - Great performance, good battery life, reasonable weight.

3. [Asus Flow Z13 - Ryzen 9 AI Max+ 395](https://rog.asus.com/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/) - Best performance, lightweight, good battery life. This is not released yet, might support 128GB in some regions. State of the art CPU.

If you can buy and use a macbook, then there's no competition. Just use a macbook. Especially [Macbook Air 15 inch](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/15-inch-sky-blue-m4-chip-with-10-core-cpu-10-core-gpu-16gb-memory-256gb). Nothing can beat this in price or performance especially when you factor in battery life.
